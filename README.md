# Ecological Determinants of Body Mass in Giraffes

This repository contains an academic coursework project completed as part of the
Programming in R module (MSc Bioinformatics, University of Bristol).

The project investigates environmental and ecological drivers of giraffe body
mass using exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, and linear
mixed-effects modelling in R. The analysis was conducted in a fully reproducible
RMarkdown workflow, with results presented in both RMarkdown and HTML formats.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory visualisation using ggplot2
- Linear mixed-effects models to account for site-level variation
- Model diagnostics and interpretation

## Files
- `giraffe_body_mass_report_pd25082.Rmd` – Reproducible analysis and code
- `giraffe_body_mass_report_pd25082.html` – Rendered report output
